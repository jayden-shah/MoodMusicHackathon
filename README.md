# moodmusic_rumad

A  Flutter project by Jayden Shah and Aarav Purohit.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. We use the spotify API to take in user inpute on song genre, artist, and produce an output of reccomended songs. Following this, you can add songs to a liked songs section. You can also create an empty playlist that directly links to your spotify account.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
